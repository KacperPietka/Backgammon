Hi, this project is a console board game backgammon.
It allows to play a whole game between two players (on the same computer) with hits and all of the backgammon rules.
It shows available columns to move, which player currently moves and result of a die throw.
After every move status of the board is saved to a .txt file and players can start new game with the last saved position and continue playing (till the end) from that position.
(At the end player needs to click 'd' for game to end as an imitation of a last die throw and then winner is displayed)
