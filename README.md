Hi, this project is a console board game backgammon.
It allows to play a whole game between two players (on the same computer) with hits and all of the backgammon rules.
It shows available columns to move, which player currently moves and result of a die throw.
(At the end player needs to click 'd' for game to end as an imitation of a last die throw and then winner is displayed)
